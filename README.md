Here’s my MVP: talentvisa.vercel.app
You can continue as a guest, and the top two buttons let you access the Employer Dashboard and Admin Dashboard.

Here’s the idea:

TalentVisa is redefining how talent is discovered and measured. Traditional 15-minute interviews and repetitive screening rounds end up wasting time for both companies and candidates. Most firms conduct multiple stages just to filter out unskilled applicants — a process that’s slow, costly, and inefficient.

Talent Rank solves this by creating a standardized scoring system across key fields (coding, personality, etc.) that keeps resume inflation in check and validates actual skill.

Using real-world simulations and tests conducted in secure, proctored environments, we generate authentic skill scores that help companies identify true talent early. This cuts down unnecessary interviews, shortens hiring cycles, and improves selection quality for everyone involved.

No AI cheating. No bluffing. Just proven skills.

As the talent acquisition market evolves rapidly, Talent Rank bridges the gap between capable individuals and smart recruiters.
TalentVisa — where skill replaces guesswork.

The MVP includes employer and admin dashboards, and the entire front end is functional. The core idea isn’t just AI-based filtering — it’s about physical simulation centres across the country that verify what’s written on a resume and issue a “Talent Visa.” With this, candidates can skip preliminary rounds like logic and vocabulary tests, and companies no longer need to conduct them.

I’ve put a lot of work into the Talent Ranking System — over 150 iterations — to refine both the scoring and filtering models. You can explore the admin panel and load the default sample data to view the analytics dashboard. CSV upload works too, but it’s optional.

I plan to build much more on this after my exams finish in November, and I’d love to keep developing it further.
